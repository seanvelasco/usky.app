				<h3>About usky.app</h3>
				<p>
					usky.app is a lightweight (29.91 kB gzipped) and minimalist
					web client for the decentralized social network, Bluesky.
				</p>
				<p>
					usky.app allows you to see what's happening in Bluesky, join
					the conversation, discover new things, and look up people
					you know.
				</p>
				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>
					Having no Twitter account (I only have Facebook), I
					painfully learned there are numerous parts of what makes a
					post. I thought,{' '}
					<i>
						"is this post an original post or a repost, is this a
						parent post or a reply post, how many replies does this
						have, does this have an embed, how many types of embeds
						are there, how do I check if this post is NSFW or
						deleted."
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					What started out as a humble side project became a frontend
					experiment of figuring out how to piece together posts to
					form a thread or a feed. The end result is this app.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Why the name <i>usky.app</i>?
				</h3>
				<p>There are three reasons why it's called usky.app.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						It's a tiny, minimalist, and lightweight client for
						Bluesky. So it's like, ÂµBluesky.
					</li>
					<li>
						If someone wants to view a Bluesky profile or post, but
						they don't have an account yet, they can easily preview
						the content by changing just one character in the URL -
						change <i>b</i>sky.app to <i>u</i>
						sky.app .
					</li>
					<li>All the good domain names are taken.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Stack</h3>
				<p>
					usky.app is a statically exported Solid.js SPA and PWA
					(previously a server-rendered SvelteKit app). Uses CSS
					modules for styling. Has 9 external dependencies: solid-js
					@solidjs/router, @solidjs/meta, @solid-primitives/storage,
					@ipld/car, @ipld/dag-cbor, cbor-x, hls.js, and @atproto/api.
					All icons are from Heroicons (including app logo).
				</p>
				<h3>Developer</h3>
				<p>
					Developed by{' '}
					<a target='_blank' href='https://seanvelasco.com'>
						Sean Velasco
					</a>
					, a Software Engineer based in the Philippines.
